# Real Estate Pricing Prediction

## Proposal

### Chapter 1: Business Overview

**1.1 Introduction**

The real estate market is a dynamic and complex environment where precise pricing is crucial. Inaccurate pricing can lead to properties languishing on the market, missed opportunities, and financial losses. We aim to address this challenge by applying multilinear regression to create a data-driven solution for transparent, efficient, and informed pricing.

**1.2 Challenges**

Real estate faces challenges of overpricing and the lack of a reliable decision framework. Overpricing hampers sales and profitability, while buyers struggle to find properties within their budget.

**1.3 Problem Statement**

Our project focuses on accurately pricing houses in the market to benefit sellers and buyers. We aim to provide a data-driven solution for precise price predictions and informed decision-making.

**1.4 Objectives**

a). Build a multilinear regression model to accurately estimate house prices based on property features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location. This model will help in setting competitive prices for properties.

b). Determine the most influential factors affecting house prices in King County, including property characteristics and geographical location.

c). Assess the effectiveness of the house price prediction model by evaluating metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared values, and residual analysis.

d). Deliver actionable recommendations to the Real Estate Agency to enhance profitability and market competitiveness, leveraging insights from the model's analysis.

### Chapter 2: Data Understanding

**2.1 Numerical Variables**

We identify and describe numerical variables in the dataset, including bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more.

**2.2 Categorical Variables**

We explore categorical variables like waterfront, view quality, and ZIP codes to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

### Chapter 3: Data Cleaning

In this chapter, we prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling by addressing duplicates and missing values.

### Chapter 4: EDA & Feature Engineering

We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to enhance the model's predictive power.

### Chapter 5: Data Analysis and Modeling

In this chapter, we delve into data analysis and modeling, where we build and evaluate our multilinear regression model.

### Chapter 6: Conclusion

We conclude our findings and discuss the limitations and future steps.

### Chapter 7: Appendix
