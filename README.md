# Real Estate Pricing Prediction

## Proposal

### Chapter 1: Business Overview

**1.1 Introduction**

The real estate market is a dynamic and complex environment where precise pricing is crucial. Inaccurate pricing can lead to properties languishing on the market, missed opportunities, and financial losses. We aim to address this challenge by applying multilinear regression to create a data-driven solution for transparent, efficient, and informed pricing.

**1.2 Challenges**

Real estate faces challenges of overpricing and the lack of a reliable decision framework. Overpricing hampers sales and profitability, while buyers struggle to find properties within their budget.

**1.3 Problem Statement**

Our project focuses on accurately pricing houses in the market to benefit sellers and buyers. We aim to provide a data-driven solution for precise price predictions and informed decision-making.

**1.4 Objectives**

a). Build a multilinear regression model to accurately estimate house prices based on property features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location. This model will help in setting competitive prices for properties.

b). Determine the most influential factors affecting house prices in King County, including property characteristics and geographical location.

c). Assess the effectiveness of the house price prediction model by evaluating metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared values, and residual analysis.

d). Deliver actionable recommendations to the Real Estate Agency to enhance profitability and market competitiveness, leveraging insights from the model's analysis.

### Chapter 2: Data Understanding

**2.1 Numerical Variables**

We identify and describe numerical variables in the dataset, including bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more.

**2.2 Categorical Variables**

We explore categorical variables like waterfront, view quality, and ZIP codes to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

### Chapter 3: Data Cleaning

In this chapter, we prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling by addressing duplicates and missing values.
**Missing Values in Waterfront, View, and Yr_renovated Columns**

We've identified missing values in the Waterfront, View (albeit relatively few), and Yr_renovated columns.

**Addressing Missing Values:**
Since both the Waterfront and View columns contain a substantial number of missing values, simply dropping them is not a viable solution. Instead, we propose a more data-driven approach. We'll group the data by zipcodes and replace the missing values with the mode (most common value) for each specific zipcode. This approach is grounded in the reasonable assumption that properties in the same zipcode share similar characteristics, particularly regarding waterfront and views.

This data imputation strategy ensures that our dataset remains comprehensive and is based on a plausible assumption about the correlation between housing features and location.

### Chapter 4: EDA & Feature Engineering

We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to enhance the model's predictive power:

1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.

2. Feature selection and creation to enhance model performance.

3. Data transformation for better model compatibility.

### Chapter 5: Data Analysis and Modeling

In this chapter, we delve into data analysis and modeling, where we build and evaluate our multilinear regression model.

### Chapter 6: Recommendation

Technical

1. **Explore Ensemble Methods**: Consider using ensemble methods such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to capture complex relationships in the data and potentially improve the model's predictive accuracy.

2. **Evaluate Nonlinear Relationships**: Explore the use of nonlinear algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Neural Networks to capture intricate patterns and interactions among the features, allowing for more sophisticated modeling of the data.

3. **Examine Regularized Models**: Investigate the performance of regularized models, including Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression, to further enhance the model's stability and generalizability while mitigating the impact of multicollinearity.

4. **Assess Tree-Based Models**: Assess the suitability of decision tree-based models like XGBoost or LightGBM, which can handle complex feature interactions and deliver superior performance in handling large datasets.

5. **Validate on Diverse Datasets**: Validate the model on diverse datasets to ensure its effectiveness across various real-world scenarios and to confirm its suitability for making accurate predictions in different market conditions.

Non-technical

1. **Emphasize Important Features**: Highlight the importance of living space, bedrooms, and bathrooms in property listings to attract potential buyers.

2. **Stress Renovation Potential**: Promote the value of properties with recent renovations, as they tend to attract buyers looking for move-in-ready homes.

3. **Consider Neighborhood View**: Highlight properties with appealing views to capture the interest of potential buyers who value scenic surroundings.

4. **Educate on Basement Benefits**: Inform buyers about the advantages of properties with a basement, such as additional space for storage or living areas.

5. **Market Waterfront Properties**: Showcase properties with a waterfront location, emphasizing the premium value associated with such desirable features.

6. **Price Competitively**: Use the insights from the predictive model to set competitive prices for properties, considering the influence of various features on property prices.
